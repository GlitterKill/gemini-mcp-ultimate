# First Steps

Once installed, here's how to get started with Gemini MCP Ultimate.

## Test Connection

Use the ping tool to verify the MCP server is working:
```
Use the gemini-mcp-ultimate ping tool with message "Hello!"
```

## Basic File Analysis

Analyze a single file using ask-gemini:
```
Use ask-gemini with prompt "@README.md summarize this"
```

## Natural Language Usage

Just ask naturally:
- "Use gemini to explain this codebase"
- "Ask gemini to analyze the architecture"
- "Have gemini review this function"

## Sandbox Testing

Test code safely with sandbox mode:
```
Use ask-gemini with prompt "create a Python fibonacci script" and sandbox: true
```
